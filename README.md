# fullyConnectedNN_MNIST

This is the "Hello World" equivalent of Machine Learning: 
a two fully connected layers neural network trained on the MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset to classify digits.
The network has an input layer of size 784, as the inputs are 28x28 grayscale images, an hidden layer of size 500 and an ouput layer of size 10 (digits from 0 to 9).
